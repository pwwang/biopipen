    """Immuarch - Loading data

    Load the raw data into [`immunarch`](https://immunarch.com) object,
    using [`immunarch::repLoad()`](https://immunarch.com/reference/repLoad.html).

    For the data path specified at `TCRData` in the input file, we will first find
    `filtered_contig_annotations.csv` and `filtered_config_annotations.csv.gz` in the
    path. If neighter of them exists, we will find `all_contig_annotations.csv` and
    `all_contig_annotations.csv.gz` in the path and a warning will be raised
    (You can find it at `./.pipen/<pipeline-name>/ImmunarchLoading/0/job.stderr`).

    If none of the files exists, an error will be raised.

    This process will also generate a text file with the information for each cell.
    The file will be saved at
    `./.pipen/<pipeline-name>/ImmunarchLoading/0/output/<prefix>.tcr.txt`.
    The file can be used by the `SeuratMetadataMutater` process to integrate the
    TCR-seq data into the `Seurat` object for further integrative analysis.
    `envs.metacols` can be used to specify the columns to be exported to the text file.

    Input:
        metafile: The meta data of the samples
            A tab-delimited file
            Two columns are required:
            * `Sample` to specify the sample names.
            * `TCRData` to assign the path of the data to the samples,
            and this column will be excluded as metadata.
            Immunarch is able to fetch the sample names from the names of
            the target files. However, 10x data yields result like
            `filtered_contig_annotations.csv`, which doesn't have any name
            information.

    Output:
        rdsfile: The RDS file with the data and metadata, which can be processed by
            other `immunarch` functions.
        metatxt: The meta data at cell level, which can be used to attach to the Seurat object

    Envs:
        prefix: The prefix to the barcodes. You can use placeholder like `{Sample}_`
            to use the meta data from the `immunarch` object. The prefixed barcodes will
            be saved in `out.metatxt`. The `immunarch` object keeps the original barcodes, but
            the prefix is saved at `immdata$prefix`.

            /// Note
            This option is useful because the barcodes for the cells from scRNA-seq
            data are usually prefixed with the sample name, for example,
            `Sample1_AAACCTGAGAAGGCTA-1`. However, the barcodes for the cells from
            scTCR-seq data are usually not prefixed with the sample name, for example,
            `AAACCTGAGAAGGCTA-1`. So we need to add the prefix to the barcodes for
            the scTCR-seq data, and it is easier for us to integrate the data from
            different sources later.
            ///

        tmpdir: The temporary directory to link all data files.
            `Immunarch` scans a directory to find the data files. If the data files
            are not in the same directory, we can link them to a temporary directory
            and pass the temporary directory to `Immunarch`.
            This option is useful when the data files are in different directories.
        mode: Either "single" for single chain data or "paired" for
            paired chain data. For `single`, only TRB chain will be kept
            at `immdata$data`, information for other chains will be
            saved at `immdata$tra` and `immdata$multi`.
        extracols (list): The extra columns to be exported to the text file.
            You can refer to the
            [immunarch documentation](https://immunarch.com/articles/v2_data.html#immunarch-data-format)
            to get a sense for the full list of the columns.
            The columns may vary depending on the data source.
            The columns from `immdata$meta` and some core columns, including
            `Barcode`, `CDR3.aa`, `Clones`, `Proportion`, `V.name`, `J.name`, and
            `D.name` will be exported by default. You can use this option to
            specify the extra columns to be exported.

        filterfile: A config file in TOML.
            A dict of configurations with keys as the names of the group and
            values dicts with following keys.
            See `envs.filters`


    Output:
        outfile: The filtered `immdata`
        groupfile: Also a group file with rownames as cells and column names as
            each of the keys in `in.filterfile` or `envs.filters`. The values
            will be subkeys of the dicts in `in.filterfile` or `envs.filters`.

    Envs:
        filters: The filters to filter the data
            You can have multiple cases (groups), the names will be the keys of
            this dict, values are also dicts with keys the methods supported by
            `immunarch::repFilter()`.
            There is one more method `by.count` supported to filter the
            count matrix. For `by.meta`, `by.repertoire`, `by.rep`,
            `by.clonotype` or `by.col` the values will be passed to
            `.query` of `repFilter()`.
            You can also use the helper functions provided by `immunarch`,
            including `morethan`, `lessthan`, `include`, `exclude` and
            `interval`. If these functions are not used, `include(value)` will
            be used by default.
            For `by.count`, the value of `filter` will be passed to
            `dplyr::filter()` to filter the count matrix.
            You can also specify `ORDER` to define the filtration order, which
            defaults to 0, higher `ORDER` gets later executed.
            Each subkey/subgroup must be exclusive

    """Exploration of Single-cell and Bulk T-cell/Antibody Immune Repertoires

    See <https://immunarch.com/articles/web_only/v3_basic_analysis.html>

    After [`ImmunarchLoading`](!!#biopipennstcrimmunarchloading) loads the raw data into an [immunarch](https://immunarch.com) object,
    this process wraps the functions from [`immunarch`](https://immunarch.com) to do the following:

    - Basic statistics, provided by [`immunarch::repExplore`](https://immunarch.com/reference/repExplore.html), such as number of clones or distributions of lengths and counts.
    - The clonality of repertoires, provided by [`immunarch::repClonality`](https://immunarch.com/reference/repClonality.html)
    - The repertoire overlap, provided by [`immunarch::repOverlap`](https://immunarch.com/reference/repOverlap.html)
    - The repertoire overlap, including different clustering procedures and PCA, provided by [`immunarch::repOverlapAnalysis`](https://immunarch.com/reference/repOverlapAnalysis.html)
    - The distributions of V or J genes, provided by [`immunarch::geneUsage`](https://immunarch.com/reference/geneUsage.html)
    - The diversity of repertoires, provided by [`immunarch::repDiversity`](https://immunarch.com/reference/repDiversity.html)
    - The dynamics of repertoires across time points/samples, provided by [`immunarch::trackClonotypes`](https://immunarch.com/reference/trackClonotypes.html)
    - The spectratype of clonotypes, provided by [`immunarch::spectratype`](https://immunarch.com/reference/spectratype.html)
    - The distributions of kmers and sequence profiles, provided by [`immunarch::getKmers`](https://immunarch.com/reference/getKmers.html)
    - The V-J junction circos plots, implemented within the script of this process.

    Environment Variable Design:
        With different sets of arguments, a single function of the above can perform different tasks.
        For example, `repExplore` can be used to get the statistics of the size of the repertoire,
        the statistics of the length of the CDR3 region, or the statistics of the number of
        the clonotypes. Other than that, you can also have different ways to visualize the results,
        by passing different arguments to the [`immunarch::vis`](https://immunarch.com/reference/vis.html) function.
        For example, you can pass `.by` to `vis` to visualize the results of `repExplore` by different groups.

        Before we explain each environment variable in details in the next section, we will give some examples here to show how the environment variables are organized in order for a single function to perform different tasks.

        ```toml
        # Repertoire overlapping
        [Immunarch.envs.overlaps]
        # The method to calculate the overlap, passed to `repOverlap`
        method = "public"
        ```

        What if we want to calculate the overlap by different methods at the same time? We can use the following configuration:

        ```toml
        [Immunarch.envs.overlaps.cases]
        Public = { method = "public" }
        Jaccard = { method = "jaccard" }
        ```

        Then, the `repOverlap` function will be called twice, once with `method = "public"` and once with `method = "jaccard"`. We can also use different arguments to visualize the results. These arguments will be passed to the `vis` function:

        ```toml
        [Immunarch.envs.overlaps.cases.Public]
        method = "public"
        vis_args = { "-plot": "heatmap2" }

        [Immunarch.envs.overlaps.cases.Jaccard]
        method = "jaccard"
        vis_args = { "-plot": "heatmap2" }
        ```

        `-plot` will be translated to `.plot` and then passed to `vis`.

        If multiple cases share the same arguments, we can use the following configuration:

        ```toml
        [Immunarch.envs.overlaps]
        vis_args = { "-plot": "heatmap2" }

        [Immunarch.envs.overlaps.cases]
        Public = { method = "public" }
        Jaccard = { method = "jaccard" }
        ```

        For some results, there are futher analysis that can be performed. For example, for the repertoire overlap, we can perform clustering and PCA (see also <https://immunarch.com/articles/web_only/v4_overlap.html>):

        ```R
        imm_ov1 <- repOverlap(immdata$data, .method = "public", .verbose = F)
        repOverlapAnalysis(imm_ov1, "mds") %>% vis()
        repOverlapAnalysis(imm_ov1, "tsne") %>% vis()
        ```

        In such a case, we can use the following configuration:

        ```toml
        [Immunarch.envs.overlaps]
        method = "public"

        [Immunarch.envs.overlaps.analyses.cases]
        MDS = { "-method": "mds" }
        TSNE = { "-method": "tsne" }
        ```

        Then, the `repOverlapAnalysis` function will be called twice on the result generated by `repOverlap(immdata$data, .method = "public")`, once with `.method = "mds"` and once with `.method = "tsne"`. We can also use different arguments to visualize the results. These arguments will be passed to the `vis` function:

        ```toml
        [Immunarch.envs.overlaps]
        method = "public"

        [Immunarch.envs.overlaps.analyses]
        # See: <https://immunarch.com/reference/vis.immunr_hclust.html>
        vis_args = { "-plot": "best" }

        [Immunarch.envs.overlaps.analyses.cases]
        MDS = { "-method": "mds" }
        TSNE = { "-method": "tsne" }
        ```

        Generally, you don't need to specify `cases` if you only have one case. A default case will be created for you. For multiple cases, the arguments at the same level as `cases` will be inherited by all cases.

    Examples:
        ```toml
        [Immunarch.envs.kmers]
        k = 5
        ```

        ![Immunarch kmers](https://immunarch.com/articles/web_only/v9_kmers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

        ```toml
        [Immunarch.envs.kmers]
        # Shared by cases
        k = 5

        [Immunarch.envs.kmers.cases]
        Head5 = { head = 5, -position = "stack" }
        Head10 = { head = 10, -position = "fill" }
        Head30 = { head = 30, -position = "dodge" }
        ```

        ![Immunarch kmers](https://immunarch.com/articles/web_only/v9_kmers_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

        With motif profiling:

        ```toml
        [Immunarch.envs.kmers]
        k = 5

        [Immnuarch.envs.kmers.profiles.cases]
        TextPlot = { method = "self", vis_args = { "-plot": "text" } }
        SeqPlot = { method = "self", vis_args = { "-plot": "seq" } }
        ```

            This analysis is not included in `immunarch`. It is a separate implementation using [`circlize`](https://github.com/jokergoo/circlize).
            - by: Groupings to show VJ usages. Typically, this is the `Sample` column, so that the VJ usages are shown for each sample.
                But you can also use other columns, such as `Subject` to show the VJ usages for each subject.
                Multiple columns should be separated by `,`.

            - subset: Subset the data before plotting VJ usages.
                The whole data will be expanded to cell level, and then subsetted.
                Clone sizes will be re-calculated based on the subsetted data, which will affect the VJ usages at cell level (by_clones=False).

class CloneResidency(Proc):
    """Identification of clone residency

    This process is used to investigate the residency of clones in groups, typically two
    samples (e.g. tumor and normal) from the same patient. But it can be used for any two groups of clones.

    There are three types of output from this process

    - Count tables of the clones in the two groups

        | CDR3_aa          | Tumor | Normal |
        |------------------|-------|--------|
        | CASSYGLSWGSYEQYF | 306   | 55     |
        | CASSVTGAETQYF    | 295   | 37     |
        | CASSVPSAHYNEQFF  | 197   | 9      |
        | ...              | ...   | ...    |

    - Residency plots showing the residency of clones in the two groups

        ![CloneResidency_residency](https://pwwang.github.io/immunopipe/latest/processes/images/CloneResidency.png)

        The points in the plot are jittered to avoid overplotting. The x-axis is the residency in the first group and
        the y-axis is the residency in the second group. The size of the points are relative to the normalized size of
        the clones. You may identify different types of clones in the plot based on their residency in the two groups:

        - Collapsed (The clones that are collapsed in the second group)
        - Dual (The clones that are present in both groups with equal size)
        - Expanded (The clones that are expanded in the second group)
        - First Group Multiplet (The clones only in the First Group with size > 1)
        - Second Group Multiplet (The clones only in the Second Group with size > 1)
        - First Group Singlet (The clones only in the First Group with size = 1)
        - Second Group Singlet (The clones only in the Second Group with size = 1)

        This idea is borrowed from this paper:

        > [Wu, Thomas D., et al. "Peripheral T cell expansion predicts tumour infiltration and clinical response." Nature 579.7798 (2020): 274-278.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2056-8)

    - Venn diagrams showing the overlap of the clones in the two groups

        ![CloneResidency_venn](https://pwwang.github.io/immunopipe/latest/processes/images/CloneResidency_venn.png){: width="60%"}

    Input:
        immdata: The data loaded by `immunarch::repLoad()`
        metafile: A cell-level metafile, where the first column must be the cell barcodes
            that match the cell barcodes in `immdata`. The other columns can be any
            metadata that you want to use for the analysis. The loaded metadata will be
            left-joined to the converted cell-level data from `immdata`.
            This can also be a Seurat object RDS file. If so, the `sobj@meta.data` will
            be used as the metadata.

    Output:
        outdir: The output directory

    Envs:
        subject (list): The key of subject in metadata. The clone
            residency will be examined for this subject/patient
        group: The key of group in metadata. This usually marks the samples
            that you want to compare. For example, Tumor vs Normal,
            post-treatment vs baseline
            It doesn't have to be 2 groups always. If there are more than 3
            groups, instead of venn diagram, upset plots will be used.
        order (list): The order of the values in `group`. In scatter/residency plots,
            `X` in `X,Y` will be used as x-axis and `Y` will be used as y-axis.
            You can also have multiple orders. For example: `["X,Y", "X,Z"]`.
            If you only have two groups, you can set `order = ["X", "Y"]`, which will
            be the same as `order = ["X,Y"]`.
        section: How the subjects aligned in the report. Multiple subjects with
            the same value will be grouped together.
            Useful for cohort with large number of samples.
        mutaters (type=json): The mutaters passed to `dplyr::mutate()` on
            the cell-level data converted from `in.immdata`. If `in.metafile` is
            provided, the mutaters will be applied to the joined data.
            The keys will be the names of the new columns, and the values will be the
            expressions. The new names can be used in `subject`, `group`, `order` and
            `section`.
        subset: The filter passed to `dplyr::filter()` to filter the data for the cells
            before calculating the clone residency. For example, `Clones > 1` to filter
            out singletons.
        prefix: The prefix of the cell barcodes in the `Seurat` object.
        upset_ymax: The maximum value of the y-axis in the upset bar plots.
        upset_trans: The transformation to apply to the y axis of upset bar plots.
            For example, `log10` or `sqrt`. If not specified, the y axis will be
            plotted as is. Note that the position of the bar plots will be dodged
            instead of stacked when the transformation is applied.
            See also <https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/3671>
        cases (type=json): If you have multiple cases, you can use this argument

    Input:
        immdata: The data loaded by `immunarch::repLoad()`, saved in RDS format
        srtobj: The `Seurat` object, saved in RDS format, used to get the
            metadata for each cell (e.g. cell type)
            It could also be a tab delimited file with `meta.data` of the
            `Seurat` object.
            It has to have a `Sample` column, which is used to match the
            `immdata` object.
            It is optional, if not provided, the metadata from the `immdata`
            object will be used.

    Output:
        outdir: The output directory

    Envs:
        group: The key of group in metadata to define the groups to
            compare. For example, `CellType`, which has cell types annotated
            for each cell in the combined object (immdata + Seurat metadata)
        comparison (type=json): A dict of two groups, with keys as the
            group names and values as the group labels. For example,
            ```toml
            Treg = ["CD4 CTL", "CD4 Naive", "CD4 TCM", "CD4 TEM"]
            Tconv = "Tconv"
            ```
        prefix: The prefix of the cell names (rownames) in the metadata.
            The prefix is usually not needed in immdata, as the data is stored
            in the `immdata` object separately for each sample. However, the
            `Seurat` object has a combined `meta.data` for all the samples,
            so the prefix is needed. Usually, the prefix is the sample name.
            For example, `Sample1-AACGTTGAGGCTACGT-1`.
            We need this prefix to add the sample name to the cell names in
            immdata, so that we can match the cells in `immdata` and
            `Seurat` object. Set it to `None` or an empty string if the
            `Seurat` object has the same cell names as `immdata`. You can use
            placeholders to specify the prefix, e.g., `{Sample}_`. In such a
            case, the `Sample` column must exist in the `Seurat` object.
        target: Which group to use as the target group. The target
            group will be labeled as 1, and the other group will be labeled as
            0 in the regression.
        subset: A column, or a list of columns separated by comma,
            in the merged object to subset the cells to perform the regression,
            for each group in the columns.
            If not provided, all the cells will be used.

    """Tessa is a Bayesian model to integrate T cell receptor (TCR) sequence
    profiling with transcriptomes of T cells.

    Enabled by the recently developed single cell sequencing techniques, which provide
    both TCR sequences and RNA sequences of each T cell concurrently, Tessa maps the
    functional landscape of the TCR repertoire, and generates insights into
    understanding human immune response to diseases. As the first part of tessa,
    BriseisEncoder is employed prior to the Bayesian algorithm to capture the TCR
    sequence features and create numerical embeddings. We showed that the reconstructed
    Atchley Factor matrices and CDR3 sequences, generated through the numerical
    embeddings, are highly similar to their original counterparts. The CDR3 peptide
    sequences are constructed via a RandomForest model applied on the reconstructed
    Atchley Factor matrices.

    See <https://github.com/jcao89757/TESSA>

    When finished, two columns will be added to the `meta.data` of the `Seurat` object:

    - `TESSA_Cluster`: The cluster assignments from TESSA.
    - `TESSA_Cluster_Size`: The number of cells in each cluster.

    These columns can be then used for further downstream analysis to explore the
    functional landscape of the TCR repertoire.
